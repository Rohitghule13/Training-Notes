                India is a country where people of all cultures and religions coexist together. I suppose that each of us has dreamt about some version of India. Obviously, we may dream about anything at any time, and as Indian citizens, we are continuously looking for
                methods to improve our country and see a better India. Peace and prosperity are my hopes for our great country. India will be a great country when every citizen follows the rule of law, supports the nation with their families, and does
                something to make India a better place.</p>
