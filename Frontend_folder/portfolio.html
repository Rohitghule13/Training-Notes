            <label class="divstyle" style="display: inline-block;"><a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">Cricket</a><p>There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England. The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, and in the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have derived from bowls, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away.</p></label>
            <label class="divstyle" style="display: inline-block;"><a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Playing Chess</a><p>Today we know that chess originated from the Gupta Empire (600CE), of India. However many people firmly believe that chess was played by the ancient Egyptians. But, the game we think of as chess and what the Egyptians used to play are completely different. Simply put, the Egyptians played something different that resembled chess. Despite this, we really don't know who first came up with the game, but it can be traced officially back to India.</p></label>
            <label class="divstyle" style="display: inline-block;"><a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel">Travelling With Friends<p>The best travel quotes are often the deepest and most powerful. As a travel blogger, I always look to travel quotes for guidance, wanderlust, and inspiration. For years, I’ve been collecting quotes about travel while traveling the world, and always enjoy reflecting on them in my day-to-day life. Everyone has a different lens through which they view the world, which is why it’s important to heed the advice and insight of others.</p></a></label>
