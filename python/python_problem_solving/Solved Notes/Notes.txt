1. Convert Hours into Seconds
Logic = I used function,row and class for converting Hours into seconds the logic is 1 hour contain 60min and 1 minute contain 60 seconds so i converting hours into the minutes and minutes into seconds 
So this problem solved in multiple ways also using exception handling 

2. Return the Sum of Two Numbers
Logic = This is simple problem statement i solved this problem in different ways using function, row, class and also used exception handling also, i get two input from user and + operator used for summing the number like function return a+b,in row print(a+b), in class return a+b

3. Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed
Logic = in this problem statement i get input from user and simply add with one to get next integer number its like iterate by one like : a += 1 where in (a) contan next value after this operation 

4. Return the Remainder from Two Numbers
Logic = In this problem statement i get two input from user and used % module sign to perform the operation and also used exception handling 

5. Return a String as an Integer
Logic = I get the input from user as string it convert into integer using int() function so perform this problem in different ways using exception handling 

6. Convert Age to Days
Logic = We know in a year there are 336 days so and age is in year like 23*336 = 7728  age*336 = result
Hence perform this operation to multiple ways using exception handling 

7. Power Calculator
Logic = I get input from user like (a**b) and print out the output and also this problem i solved using different ways like function, row, class and also one function which is pow(a,b)

8. Boolean to String Conversion
Logic = using str() function i made this conversion

9. Return the First Element in a List
Logic = I create list and give index as 0 because list index is start from 0 so eventually first element is at 0 index

10. Football Points
Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculates the number of points a football team has obtained so far.
wins get 3 points
draws get 1 point
losses get 0 points
Logic = i set the win point is equal to 20 and loss team gets 0 so on this logic there was function to calculate it

11. The Farm Problem
In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
Logic = chicken have 2 legs so chicken*2
Cows have 4 leges so cows*4
Pigs have 4 legs so pigs*4
So totally add the result of each and we get total number of legs

12. Convert Hours and Minutes into Seconds
Logic = Its like previous problem similar solving method i used in different ways like function, row, and class method 

13. String to Integer and Vice Versa
Logic = using int() And str() function i made the solution over it and also using different ways try to solve the problem hence also exception handling is there  

14. Check if objOne Is Equal to objTwo
Create a function that checks to see if two object arguments are equal to one another. Return True if the objects are equal, otherwise, return False.
Logic = in python there are all in object so we can check the object properties using (is) keyword such as ( x is y ) return true if they are same else false

15. Find the Largest Number in a List
Create a function that takes a list of numbers. Return the largest number in the list.

21. Check if an Integer is Divisible By Five
Create a function that returns True if an integer is evenly divisible by 5, and False otherwise.
Logic = it is quite simple problem statement of i need to chcek only if the given number is divisible by 5 hence its remainder is 0 so i return the conditional statement like 
     if a%5==0:

22. Get the Sum of All List Elements
Create a function that takes a list and returns the sum of all numbers in the list.
Logic = i create function for it solved this problem in multiple ways like there have in build function sum() this function return the addition of all content in list hence there have addition logic to iterate list element one by one and add them i did both

23. Compare Strings by Count of Characters
Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and return either True or False depending on whether the total number of characters in the first string is equal to the total number of characters in the second string.
Logic = i counted the character in the string and compare to the other string if it is equal return True or False

24. Divides Evenly
Given two integers, a and b, return True if a can be divided evenly by b. Return False otherwise.
Logic = i get input from user and divide by 2 and compare the remainder with 0 is eual to 0 so input integer is even

25. Recursion to Repeat a String n Number of Times
Create a recursive function that takes two parameters and repeats the string n number of times. The first parameter text is the string to be repeated and the second parameter is the number of times the string is to be repeated.
